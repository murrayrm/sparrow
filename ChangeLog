--------
Changes for sparrow library (DGC version)
RMM, 21 Dec 03

RMM, 30 Dec 06: added stderr redirection
  * All output to stderr is now captured by sparrow
  * Output is displayed on prompt line with beep when received
  * Use dd_toggle_beep_cb to turn beep on/off (new flag: dd_quietf)
  * dd_errlog_* functions can be used to scroll through the error log

RMM, 30 Dec 06: fixed curses beep functionality
  * Curses did not beep when printing ^G (just printed "^G" on screen)
  * Created co_beep() routine; uses ^G on termcap, curses beep() otherwise

RMM, 29 Dec 06: added new "message" type
  * Use for strings where the pointer changes rather than string contents
  * See display.txi for more details

RMM, 18 Dec 06: added rebind capability
  * Use @refname to define a variable that is not initially bound
  * Use dd_rebind to reassign the address used for displaying the variable
  * See documentation and dispexmp for more examples

RMM, 31 Dec 04: minor modss that have been waiting for a while to get done
  * added "int" type, which is the same as short
  * fixed some small errors in the way variable names were set up
  * moved doc out of default make
  * added (doxygen-generated) pgmref to main documentation 

RMM, 23 Dec 04: rewrote serial test routine to use threads
  * created ptycat to test out serial interface via pty's
  * created threaded version of sertest, including mutex

RMM, 22 Dec 04: started working on programmers documentation using doxygen
  * created Doxyfile with info on how to generate documentations
  * created sparrow.h as single include file + mainpage documentation

RMM, 16 Dec 04: added code for allowing /dev/* for config.dev device addresses
  * Updated parsing operation in chnconf.c
  * Created sertest driver to test out serial driver

RMM, 11 Dec 04: added in channel code + servo code hack
  * Added in missing device driver (channel) code
  * Only including virtual + fcn-gen devices for now
  * Added back chntest to test sparrow + drivers
  * Got rid of schntest (simple chntest); no longer needed

RMM, 7 Aug 04: small improvements to debugging module
  * dbg_{out,log}f can now be used as masks with DGC_<msgtype> masks
  * created hooks to allow simple operation during display

RMM, 7 Aug 04: added documentation for debugging routines
  * added debug.txi to include list in sparrow.txi and updated Makefile
  * added additional documentation on who to use dbg_* routines

RMM, 7 Aug 04: recompiled under cygwin
  * removed extraneous timeval declaration in debug.c
  * termcap version does not link correctly on cygwin; tputs multiply defined

RMM, 3 Jul 04: modifications to allow eventual conversion to terminfo
  * Removed cgets from Makefile; should be able to delete
  * Added co_ prefix to all conio.c and termio.c defined routines
  * Created curslib.c as eventual replacement for tclib, conio, termio
  * Modified makefile to create termcap and curses versions of library

**** version 2.1h ****

RMM, 30 Jan 04: got rid of error printing in dd_load_tbl
  * This should be done by calling routine

RMM, 18 Jan 04: added keycode to dd_unbound message

RMM, 17 Jan 04: added logging file capability to dbg_printf
  * Call dbg_openlog(filename, mode) to create file
  * Also set up dbg_closelog(), dbg_flushlog()
  * Tested in vdrive; working

RMM, 14 Jan 04: fixed dd_string error
  * was using dd->current for length of string (??)
  * changed to dd->length

RMM, 13 Jan 04: updated flag capability
  * added flag_update() call into dd loop
  * set up default location for flags + created update function
  * simple testing looks OK; might be a bit slower than it could be

RMM, 13 Jan 04: fixed bug in option handling
  * in parse.y, values were set after option parsing, so it was not possible
    to change the default display manager (or example)
  * changed this to process options after setting defaults

RMM, 5 Jan 04: added rudimentary flag capability
  * use strings to keep track of flag status
  * see flag.[ch] for list of functions; compatible with sparrow docs
  * need to figure out how to get refresh to happen automatically

RMM, 4 Jan 04: added capture routines
  * put in channel and capture routines
  * requires servo code to work complete (not yet available)

RMM, 3 Jan 04: added routines to save display tables
  * grabbed ddsave.c from sparrow distribution
  * grabed chn_gettok from chnconfig.c (standalone function)

RMM, 3 Jan 04: more C++ fixes
  * created dd_{use,prv}tbl_cb to handle arguments correctly

RMM, 3 Jan 04: WRAP code not working
  * should allow cursor to wrap around screen
  * end condition in dd_find_down does not gaurantee termination
  * commented out #define WRAP for now

RMM, 2 Jan 04: bug fix for large tables
  * Increased max table size to 1024
  * Generate error message (instead of core dump) if too long

RMM, 31 Dec 03: enhanced debug routines
  * Converted dbg_printf -> dbg_{info,warn,error,panic}
  * Moved header files to ../include/sparrow/*
  * Deconflicted debug.h and dbglib.h - one no longer includes the other

RMM, 31 Dec 03: fixed but in '=' processing
  * Sparrow 3.x code had bad ddtype.c; replaced with v2.x versions

RMM, 31 Dec 03: minor tweaks to color processing
  * created flag in tclib to indicate whether terminal has color or not
  * Allows proper operaiton under vt100 w/out color capability
  * Changed getch to dd_getch to avoid curses conflict
  * Implemented curs_set from curses to try to turn cursor off

RMM, 29 Dec 03: added debugging routines to library
  * debug.c - SST code for debugging; needs work, but a start
  * debug.h - defines dbg_printf 
  * These files still need documentation; trasparent for now

RMM, 26 Dec 03: minor fixes for vehdrive
  * Declared dd_beep as callback (changed return type to int)

RMM, 21 Dec 03: updated cdd to be g++ compatible
