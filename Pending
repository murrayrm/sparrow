Date	   Req	Item
----	   ---  ----
06 Aug 08  RMM  Remove calls to falcon matrix/MATLAB routines.  These
       	   	should be replaced with calls to libmatio (if present)

05 Jul 08  RMM	Install compatible features from sparrow 3.1, 3.2
       	   	  * Look through old PC code and see what can be moved
		  
05 Jul 08  RMM	Update Makefiles to remove /dgc legacy dependencies
       	   	  * Update README file to reflect current state
       	   	  * Version number should come from master makefile
		  * Installation directory should come from master makefile

10 Jan 07  RMM	Fix Makefile.yam to create cdd before compiling .dd files

30 Dec 06  RMM	Improve stderr redirection interface
       	   	  * Small annoyances with messages at ends of buffer
		  * Allow direct logging to a file
		  * Integrate with debug routines

29 Dec 03  RMM  Configure debug routines for use when dbg_ddflg is set

03 Jan 04  RMM  Fix WRAP code

03 jan 04  RMM  Change callbacks to take void * arg instead of long;
		more portable 

04 Jan 04  RMM  Add in documentation for capture routines and dd_save/load

05 Jan 04  RMM  Finish up implementation of unix flags
                  * Add txi docs for flag usage under unix (need to
		    display flag_*)
                  * Add flag display directly to dd_loop()??

07 Aug 04  RMM  Missing documentation
	          * flag_* routines (also need to be configured to work)

07Aug04	Create debugging display to control/inspect dbg_* module
	  * show values of all current flags in the module
	  * allow functions to be added and subtracted from logs

07Aug04	Add display hooks so that dbg_* routines work with sparrow display
	  * avoid having debug.c functions call display code unnecessarily
	  * convert current code to use hook functions

4Dec04	Fix function generator to use timer instead of servo clock
	  * Commented out code that used servo_freq
	  * Use unix time commands instead

23Dec04	Finish writing servo interface
	  * Use real timing instead of sleep at end of loop
	  * Implement remaining servo routines in servo.c
