              Release Notes for "sparrow" module

Release 4.0.0 (9 Aug 08)
	This is the initial open source release of the Sparrow
	real-time control library.  This release contains most of the
	functionality of the last public release (2.x and 3.x), with
	extensions to allow operation in Linux.

Release R1-01g (Thu Sep 27 21:35:33 2007):
	Improved stderr processing: messages sent to stderr are now printed
	out at the same speed as they are received, eliminating a possible
	bottleneck when using sparrow.  If you use error logging via
	errlog_init() function, this now binds ^O to a function that turns
	off all error messages (not printed, not buffered).

	Changes documented in texinfo files.  Also added back the dispexmp
	unit test.

Release R1-01f (Sat Apr 21 11:18:31 2007):
	Added user documentation for cdd -c (in display.txi)

Release R1-01e (Wed Apr 18 11:47:12 2007):
	This release adds a -c flag to cdd that enables generation of
	separate header and code files for a dynamic display (.dd) file.
	This can be used when you want to use the definitions corresponding
	in more than one file.

	No change in functionality if -c is not specified.

Release R1-01d (Sat Mar  3  8:20:59 2007):
	Minor release to fix Makefile problem that was causing warnings
	when new packages were created.  The 'cdd' program was incorrectly
	listed in the BIN_LINKS list.  No changes to interface or
	functionality.

Release R1-01a (Sat Jan 27 19:38:00 2007):
	Minor release to fix problems with C++ linking (errlog functions).
	Changing the revision number to 01 to reflect that fact that this
	requires a recompile (this really should have been done at the
	time that we make the original C++ compatible versions in R1-00e).

Release R1-00f (Sat Jan 27 17:33:58 2007):
	This release fixes the Makefile so that the library is properly
	compiled in a single pass.  Did this by creating a local copy of
	binary, in addition to the binary that YaM makes.  A bit of a waste,
	but it seems to work find.

	Note: I tried to do this by setting up dependences on
	$(YAM_TARGET)/cdd, but this did not make it past the YaM make
	process.  I *think* the approach I used is kosher, but could have
	some unforeseen issues when we get to a multi-target environment.

Release R1-00e (Mon Jan 22 22:18:27 2007):
  	Fixed for mixed C/C++ operation.

Release R1-00d (Sat Jan 13 20:14:06 2007):
	This release contains a few small changes to the Makefile.yam to
	allow proper compilation under OSX.  Mainly reset things to what
	we already had in dgc/trunk.  No changes, except color should work
	again.

Release R1-00c (Wed Jan 10 22:34:01 2007):
	<* Pleaase insert a release notes entry here. If none, then please delete these lines *>

Release R1-00b (Tue Jan  9 14:53:31 2007):
	<* Pleaase insert a release notes entry here. If none, then please delete these lines *>

Release R1-00a (Sun Jan  7 19:45:00 2007):
	This is the initial yam version of sparrow, copied over from
	the DGC trunk.  It is not yet been converted to use YaM makefiles
	or other features.  Basically just the initial condition for this
	module.

Release R1-00 (Sat Jan  6 17:04:51 2007):
	Created.
