The sparrow library uses the standard GNU 'configure' script to
generate system specific Makefiles.  To install the library in the
default location (typically /usr/local), run the following from the
base directory:

  aclocal
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make install

To compile the user documentation, you will need the texinfo package
(available via conda).
