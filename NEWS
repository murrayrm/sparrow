Sparrow NEWS -- history of user-visible changes
RMM, 8 Aug 08

This file desribes changes in Sparrow V4.0.0.  Previous releases of
Sparrow (2.x, 3.x) were designed for operation on an IBM-PC under
MSDOS.  Starting with version 4.x, Sparrow is designed for operation
under linux.

Major differencs from the MSDOS versions:

* Support for flags is somewhat limited due to the use of curses
  instead of direct memory writes.

* Servo routines do not provide strong timing guarantees.  The linux
  version of the servo capability currently uses the linux usleep()
  function.

See ChangeLog for a more detailed list of changes.
